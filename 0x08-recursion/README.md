<h1>0x08. C - Recursion</h1>

This directory contains task files I have completed while learning about Recursion with C programming language.

0. 0-puts_recursion.c : &nbsp;prints a string followed by a new line
   - Prototype : &nbsp;`void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

1. 1-print_rev_recursion.c : prints a string in reverse
   - Prototype : &nbsp;`void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`
